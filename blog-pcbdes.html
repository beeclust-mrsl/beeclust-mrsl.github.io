						<p>All of us have seen those green colored motherboards inside computers and mobile phones. They are called Printed Circuit Board (PCB’s). Have you ever wondered what it takes to design your own PCB? This article might just give you an idea.</p>

						<h3>Understanding the PCB:</h3>

						<p>The basic function of a Printed Circuit Board(s)(PCB’s) is to contain an electronic circuit within a confined area. In layman terms, all the necessary components that are a part of the circuit like Integrated Circuits, Resistors and Capacitors to name a few are connected to the board by soldering them. The wires that are supposed to connect the components are fused into the PCB during manufacturing. The goal of PCB design is to create an all in one block like the motherboard of a PC which forms the electrical section for our project.</p>

						<p>It’s best to decide what is required from our project and how to achieve them. Based on your requirements, build your circuits. It can be on paper or any software you’re comfortable with. Upon doing this we’ll know the exact requirements for building the circuit in terms of the no. of components and other external factors like power supply.</p>

						<h3>Componenet Selection:</h3>

						<p>Finding and using the right components is the best part of PCB Design, but this can be really tricky. By using really small surface mount components you might imagine, you can get really small PCB’s. But there are limitations like: capability of your manufacturer and soldering capability of you. The manufacturing cost is really high if the size of the pads, traces or vias (refer the Terminologies given below) in your PCB are smaller than a certain limit as per the manufacturer. Second, components that are too small cannot be handled by a human and can become impossible to solder at home.</p>

						<p>So once you’ve chosen the components, check the price and availability with vendors. Sometimes we might have to replace components that are too expensive. So it’s always better to find the components first.</p>

						<h3>Steps involved in PCB Design:</h3>
						<ol>
  							<li>
  								<b>Select a software for Electronic Design Automation(EDA):</b> 
  								Consider the cost, reliability and good support. Autodesk Eagle is pretty good for intermediate level PCB designs, has almost every component you’ll need and students can avail a license for free. EasyEda is also pretty good and has an online version too, but I would recommend you to use Eagle as I find the interface more comfortable to use.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Make the schematic:</b> 
  								Select the right packages for each component. Provide suitable interfaces to the external environment. Like power supply, programming interface for microcontrollers, debugging points. Try to use labels with appropriate names as it makes the schematic tidy. Run the Error Rule Check to verify.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Outline your board:</b>
  								Move ahead to the board editor. This can be done by: File>Switch to Board. Visualize the shape and size of your PCB and appropriately draw the outline. Select the layer as <b>‘20 Dimension‘</b> as this will be layer the manufacturer will set to cut your PCB(s) after manufacturing. I wanted to make the shape as octagon.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Place components:</b>
  								PCB Design is 90% placement and 10% routing. You can place components on both the top and bottom layers. A properly placed PCB simplifies the routing by reducing the length and no.of traces significantly. Always try to place the components in a orientation similar to that in your schematic. However, you can’t change the position of certain functional components of the system like sensors and actuators. Changing their position will mean you’ll be getting inappropriate results which wasn’t a part of your plan. Also you can’t change the position of interfaces to external environment as shown in the picture below. Always refer the datasheet provided by the manufacturer before you finalize the placement.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Define a polygon:</b>
  								A polygon is used to fill copper inside a layer of the PCB which carries a particular signal. Usually it’s used as a grounding plane and in some cases the positive supply. The polygon is used to improve the stability of your design. By defining a polygon before hand, routing becomes simpler. You can define multiple polygons also. The polygon is outlined by the red dotted line in the above image. Post filling with copper it should look like the image below.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Routing:</b>
  								Select your trace width according to the amount of current flowing through your trace. It is recommended that your trace width be a minimum of 20 mills if a current of 1A is flowing through it. The article ‘Top 10 PCB Routing Tips for Beginners‘ is a brilliant guide for great routing.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Add markings:</b>
  								One can use the silkscreen(refer terminology) layer for this. It can serve as an indicator for polarity or just a reference while soldering. You can literally add any gray scale bitmap you want.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Generate Gerber Files:</b>
  								Its the universal format used as input for the PCB manufacturing equipment. You can run the CAM processor in Eagle to select the layers you wish to include.
  								<br/>This article <a href="http://support.seeedstudio.com/knowledgebase/topics/144967-how-to-generate-pcb-gerber-files">‘How to generate PCB Gerber Files‘</a> might serve as reference.
  							</li>
						</ol>

						<p>With that the design of your first PCB is complete. You can get to know how your PCB will look post manufacturing using an online Gerber Viewer Tool like the PCBway’s. I order my PCB’s from PCBWay. Their manufacturing capability and service is really good. So that’s all it takes to custom design an all in one circuit board for your project. The biggest advantage of designing PCB’s probably is that it can scale down the size of our projects considerably. This is possible only because of the progress the semiconductor industry has made in fabricating really tiny IC’s. The design I made will look like this:</p>

						<h3>Terminologies Used</h3>
						<ul>
  							<li>
  								<b>Plated through hole:</b> 
  								A hole on a board which has an annular ring and which is plated all the way through the board. May be a connection point for a through hole component, a via to pass a signal through, or a mounting hole.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Pad:</b> 
  								A portion of exposed metal on the surface of a board to which a component is soldered (applicable to SMD Components)
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Trace:</b>
  								A continuous path of copper on a circuit board. The trace’s function can be visualized as the wire
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Via:</b>
  								A a hole in a board used to pass a signal from one layer to another. Tented vias are covered by soldermask to protect them from being soldered to. Vias where connectors and components are to be attached are often untented (uncovered) so that they can be easily soldered.
  							</li>
  							<li>
  								<b>Silkscreen:</b>
  								A the letters, number, symbols, and imagery on a circuit board. Usually only one color is available, and resolution is usually fairly low
  							</li>
						</ul>
